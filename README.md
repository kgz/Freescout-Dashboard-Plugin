# (WIP) Intuitive Dashboard and reporting Module for Freescout.
### why?
Sodium is a modern, easy-to-use software library for encryption, decryption, signatures, password hashing, and more.

It is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, and packageable fork of [NaCl](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/), with a compatible but extended API to improve usability even further


### Installation
Sodium is cross-platform and cross-language. It runs on many compilers and operating systems, including 
```Bash
git clone https://doc.libsodium.org
```

### TODO
